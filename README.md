# Machine Learning Portfolio

portfolio includes projects that i have done as a part of academic course and for self learning.

## Project 1 - Investment Analysis

#### Problem Statement
Spark Funds, an asset management company, wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

#### Objective
The main objective of the problem is to analyse the data and give answers to the following questions.
* What type of investment is suitable for the company (venture, angel, seed, and private equity) ?
* Which Country and Sector will be suitable for investment ?
* Selecting top 3 English-speaking Countries for the above selected countries.

## Project 2 - Lending Club Case Study

#### Problem Statement
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile. 

#### Objective

The main objective of the case study is to perform EDA the loan dataset and find out potential risk factors that may lead to defaulting a loan.

## Project 3 - Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

#### Problem Statement

A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. 

#### Objective

We are given a dataset containing information about US cars .We have to identify important features using EDA and create a model using linear regression that will predict the car prices for the company.

## Project 4 - House Price Prediction using Regularized Regression

#### Problem Statement

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 

### Objective

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Project 5 - Telecom Churn Case Study

#### Problem Statement

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

### Objective
Main objectives are as follows.
1. Identify the high value customers.In this case study, high-value customer is based on revenue i.e. the top 20% customers which generate the highest revenue.
2. Identify the churn factors and build a model to classify whether a customer is a potential churn customer.

## Project 6 - Vitterbi Algorithm

#### Problem Statement

You have learnt to build your own HMM-based POS tagger and implement the Viterbi algorithm using the Penn Treebank training corpus. The vanilla Viterbi algorithm we had written had resulted in ~87% accuracy. The approx. 13% loss of accuracy was majorly due to the fact that when the algorithm encountered an unknown word (i.e. not present in the training set, such as 'Twitter'), it assigned an incorrect tag arbitrarily. This is because, for unknown words, the emission probabilities for all candidate tags are 0, so the algorithm arbitrarily chooses (the first) tag.

#### Objective 

Modify the vitterbi algorithm to compensate the 13% loss of the accuracy due to unknown words.Explore atleast two approaches to solve the problem of unknown words.

## Project 7 - Chatbot with Rasa

#### Problem Statement

An Indian startup named 'Foodie' wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities. You have been hired as the lead data scientist for creating this product.

The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience. The project brief provided to you is as follows.

#### Objective

Build and train a chat bot using the open source conversation AI Rasa.The bot should give recommendations of restaurants bases on the following questions.
1. City 
2. Cuisine 
3. Budget for 2.

The Bot should also be able to send top 10 restaurant to the person via email.

## Project 8 - Neural Network using Numpy

#### Problem statement

In this project, you will build a complete neural network using Numpy. You will implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.

#### Objective

The project is divided in to 6 parts.

1.Data Preparation
2.Feedforward
3.Loss Computation
4.Backpropogation
5.Parameter updates
6.Model Training and prediction.

We have to fill the each part with the appropriate code and formulas.
